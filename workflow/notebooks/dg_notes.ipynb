    "The FASTA format is the \"workhorse\" of bioinformatics. It is used to represent sequence information. The format is deceivingly simple:\n",
    "A > symbol on the FASTA header line indicates a fasta record start.\n",
    "A string of letters called the sequence id may follow the > symbol.\n",
    "The header line may contain an arbitrary amount of text (including spaces) on the same line. Subsequent lines contain the sequence.\n",
    "The sequence is assumed to come from an alphabet that corresponds to a biological entity. For example, the standard alphabet for nucleotides would contain: ATGC . An extended alphabet may also contain the N symbol to indicate a base that could be any of ATGCN . A different extension of a nucleotide alphabet\n",
    "may allow extended symbols such as W that corresponds to nucleotide that is either an A or T etc. Gaps may be represented via . or - symbols. Search the web for \"IUPAC nucleotides\" to get a list of all such symbols that may be included in an alphabet. The same rationale needs to be followed by protein alphabets. The following is a FASTA file with two FASTA records:\n"
